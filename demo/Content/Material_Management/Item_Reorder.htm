Inventory level has to take care of sudden increase in demand as well as decrease in demand. Many factors contribute to determine the level of stock at which next order has to be placed and the quantity to be ordered like consumption patterns, lead time etc.</p><p>Reorder functionality in Amrita HIS</p><p>The application supports setting reorder values for each individual item by location (store). This means the item can have a different reorder point for each store.</p><p>User could either set the values through master screen or could configure to automatically update the values in reorder.</p><p>Reorder Master Screen</p><p>The master screens for reorder is present under the menu - Pharmacy/ Material Item Reorder (under MM Masters menu).</p><p>The screen has 3 tabs -</p><p>StockClass Master,</p><p>Item - Store - StockClass Map and</p><p>Reorder Master.</p><p>StockClassMaster Tab</p><p>A stock class defines a template of reorder properties and can be mapped to any item if it has those values. The key fields for stock class are:</p><p>Daily Consumption Algorithm</p><p>Minimum Days</p><p>Maximum Days</p><p>Avg. Lead Time</p><p>Days to Sum (Used only for Algorithm 8)</p><p>Algorithms available for calculating avg. daily consumption:</p><p>Average daily consumption for the past year(for an item displaying very stable consumption pattern)</p><p>It is calculated by taking the sum of total issue qty, total transfer qty and total consumed qty for the last one year.</p><p>Calculation: Avg. Consumption = total / 365</p><p>Average daily consumption for the past month(for item which has changing but unpredictable consumption pattern)</p><p>It is calculated by taking the sum of total issue qty, total transfer qty and total consumed qty for the last month.</p><p>Calculation: Avg. Consumption = total /no of days of last month</p><p>Average daily consumption for the same month previous year (for item which has changing but seasonal consumption pattern</p><p>It is calculated by taking the sum of total issue qty, total transfer qty and total consumed qty for the same month last year.</p><p>Calculation: Avg. Consumption = total /no of days of same month last year.</p><p>Maximum of the Average daily consumption for the last 12 monthly buckets (for old items which has to be continued and has not much seasonal pattern)</p><p>It is calculated by taking maximum of the sum of total issue qty, total transfer qty and total consumed qty for the last 12 months.</p><p>Calculation: Avg. Consumption = maximum of avgConsumption during last 12 months.</p><p>Minimum of the Average daily consumption for the last 12 monthly buckets (for old items which needs to be phased out)</p><p>It is calculated by taking minimum of the sum of total issue qty, total transfer qty and total consumed qty for the last 12 months.</p><p>Calculation: Avg. Consumption = minimum of avgConsumption during last 12 months.</p><p>Maximum daily consumption of the last four 15 day buckets (for costly items having erratic consumption pattern)</p><p>It is calculated by taking maximum of the sum of total issue qty, total transfer qty and total consumed qty for the last 15 days.</p><p>Calculation: Avg. Consumption = maximum of avgConsumption during last four 15 days.</p><p>Last 2 months average (for items having fairly constant/stable consumption pattern)</p><p>It is calculated by taking average of the sum of total issue qty, total transfer qty and total consumed qty for the last 2 months.</p><p>Calculation: Avg. Consumption = total /no of days of last two months.</p><p>Average daily consumption for the given number of days</p><p>It is calculated by taking average of the sum of total issue qty, total transfer qty and total consumed qty for given no of days.</p><p>Calculation: Avg. Consumption = total /no of days ( Days To Sum entered in Item Stock Class Master)</p><p>Table used: item_stock_class_master</p><p>Item - Store - StockClass MapTab</p><p>System supports reordering at each store level, if required. For this, map the item, store and stock class. The exec frequency has Manual, Daily, Weekly, Monthly, in 6 month, yearly. The exec.frequency other than Manual is used for cron job. The cron job will look at the cron frequency and calculate and insert the reorder values.</p><p>Table used: item_store_stockclass_map</p><p>Reorder Master Tab</p><p>Through the Reorder Master tab, user could manually set the reorder values of an item store wise. The log in store is defaulted in the Reorder Master screen.</p><p>Reorder Master Screen has fields to capture Daily Consumption, Minimum Quantity, Maximum Quantity, Reorder Level(ROL) and Reorder Quantity (ROQ).</p><p>If the item has Item Store StockClass Map entry and the exec.frequency is set as Manual, when the item is selected, the reorder values are calculated automatically and shown in the fields Daily Consumption, Minimum Qty, Max.Qty Reorder Level and Reorder Qty. Then the values can be saved.</p><p>There is an icon present near the Daily Consumption field. The button is for the user to check and get the latest avg. daily consumption value if present any and to calculate the latest reorder value based on it. User could then modify the details. For this to work, need to do the stock class and store stock class mapping as</p><p>well as the item should have any consumptions happened in the store.</p><p>Table used: item_reorder.</p><p>Screens showing Reorder details</p><p>The reorder details captured at the master level is shown in stock browsers and used in indent.</p><p>Stock Browsers</p><p>The ROL, ROQ, Min. Qty and Max. Qty are shown in the Main Stock Browser as well as in the mini stock browsers present in the indent and PRQ screens.</p><p>The stock browsers show the local stock colored, if the stock is below ROL.</p><p>Purchase Request</p><p>User could search by items that are 'Below ROL' in the stock browser present in the PRQ screen. And purchase request could be created by adding the Below ROL items.</p><p>Indent</p><p>In the Indent screen, on adding the items that are 'Below ROL' from stock browser, the ordering qty is defaulted as (Max.Qty - Stock In Hand).</p><p>Reorder Calculations</p><p>Reorder level:</p><p>ROL = Lead Time Demand + SafetyStock</p><p>where,</p><p>Lead Time Demand = Lead Time * Avg. Daily Consumption</p><p>Avg. Daily Consumption = Total qty moved out of the store / total days. (Default).</p><p>Avg. Daily Consumption = (Max. Qty + Min. Qty) / 2 (If value of app.config - MM-REORDER_AVGCONSUMPTION_METHOD is MINMAXAVG).</p><p>Safety Stock has multiple calculations supported:</p><p>Safety Stock = Min.Qty (Default)</p><p>Safety Stock = Max of Consumption for the period * Lead Time (If value of app.config - MM-REORDER_SAFETYSTOCK_METHODis LEADTIMEMAX)</p><p>Reorder Quantity:</p><p>By default,</p><p>ROQ = Max. Usable Qty - Min. Usable Qty</p><p>where,</p><p>Max. Usable Qty = Maximum Days * Avg. Daily Consumption</p><p>Min. Usable Qty = Minimum Days * Avg. Daily Consumption</p><p>ROQ = Max. Usable Qty - Local Stock ( if value of MM-REORDER_SAFETYSTOCK_METHOD is LEADTIMEMAX )</p><p>ROQ value set in reorder master is not used in the application.</p><p>Reorder Level Reports</p><p>Minimum Level Report for Materials with PRQ-PO Details</p><p>Report will show the PRQ and PO details of items that are below ROL. The report will list data only if any PRQ or PO is present for the item that are below reorder level.</p><p>Terminology</p><p>Safety Stock: This is the minimum stock balance that you want to have on hand at all times. The actual value will be heavily based on how critical the inventory item is to your operation.</p><p>Reorder Point\ Level (ROP): Reorder point is the balance level at which you want your inventory reorder to take place for the given item. The calculation is a forecast of demand over lead time plus a calculation of safety stock.</p><p>The ROP is used to trigger the reorder process for the item based on the following calculation:</p><p>References</p><p>ReorderInfo</p></div><!--End--></div>
